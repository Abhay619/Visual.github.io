<h1>VisuAl - Algorith Visualizer </h1>


Algorithm visualization illustrates how algorithms work in a graphical way. It mainly aims to simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithms operation. Within the paper we discuss the possibility of enriching the standard methods of teaching algorithms, with the algorithm visualizations. As a step in this direction, we introduce the “VisuAL” algorithm visualization platform, present our practical experiences and describe possible future directions, based on our experiences and knowledge.
